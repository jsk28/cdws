In the coding world, it's important to remember that we're all in the same boat when it comes to carbon emissions. We can't keep coding down with the ship and ignoring the looming threat of climate change. The primary cause of global warming is carbon emissions from human activities, such as transportation and energy use. It's time to steer our efforts in the right direction and take responsibility for our impact on the environment. It's not just a "Titanic effort" to reduce our carbon footprint, it's a pun-derful opportunity to make a big impact on preserving the health and well-being of our planet for future generations.

When it comes to reducing energy consumption in technology, programmers need to take a byte out of carbon emissions. Storing code on GitHub can be a real iceberg to the environment, but it doesn't have to sink us. Inefficient code can result in a lot of energy waste, and that's not a pun I want to code on my watch. We need to write code that's not just efficient, but effective in minimizing unnecessary processing and reducing file sizes. By doing so, we can avoid a coding disaster and make a significant impact on carbon emissions. As professionals, we have a responsibility to ensure our code is sustainable, and that's not just a pun, it's a coding principle. We need to be mindful of the environmental impact of our work and work towards a more sustainable future for all.

Our team developed a tool that helps to increase awareness about the environmental impact of storing code on the cloud. The tool takes in GitHub repository information and produces helpful factoids that give a better grasp of the effect of storing code on the environment. Our project was built using Node.js, and we assigned each team member tasks based on their availability and interests. We were able to overcome challenges related to our lack of mastery in this field of development by learning on the fly, and we found the process to be fun and a novel experience.

One of the accomplishments we're most proud of is our ability to fetch GitHub information and use it to provide insight into the environmental impact of code storage. Our team had limited experience with this type of project, so we worked together to learn and implement new skills. We discovered that writing efficient code is key to reducing carbon emissions, and we incorporated this principle into our project. Overall, we're proud of the progress we've made and the impact that our tool can have on increasing individual carbon awareness in the coding community. By taking responsibility for our environmental impact and making small changes, we can work towards a more sustainable future for all.
